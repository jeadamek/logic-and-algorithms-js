## ✏️ About

These are some JavaScript exercices developed on Stage 4 in the Explorer course at the [Rocketseat School](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). To access the entire course's projects [click on this link](https://github.com/jeadamek/explorer-rocketseat). 

The goal of these nine exercises is to understand and practice Logic and Algorithms using JavaScript.

The following descriptions are the challenge of each exercise:

1️⃣ Prompt the user for its name and return the message: “Olá, [user's name]”.

2️⃣ Prompt two numbers, sum the numbers and return the sum result.

3️⃣ Prompt two numbers and do the math operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and remainder of division. Return the result of each operation.

4️⃣ Prompt the user for a student's name and three grades for that student.
- Calculate the student's average grade;
- If the student passed (average >= 6), congratulate him, return "Parabéns!";
- If the student did not pass, motivate the student study for the in the recovery test;
- In both cases, return a message with the student's name and grade.

5️⃣ Prompt the user for ten items to make a grocery list. After that print them, separating each of them with a comma.

6️⃣ Guessing Game
- Show the following message to the user: "Can you guess the number that I'm thinking of? It's between  0 and 10.";
- Build a programming logic to generate a random number and check if the user's input is the same as the random number generated by the system.
- While the user doesn't guess the number right, return the message: "Error, try again.";
- If the user hits the number, display the message: "Congratulations! You guessed the number in x attempts";
- Replace the "x" in the message with the number of attempts.

7️⃣ Build a program with a menu and display the following message: "Hello user! Type the number of the desired option"
1. Register an item in the list.
2. Display registered items
3. Exit program

The program should capture the number typed by the user and show the following situation:
- Case type 1, the user can register an item in a list
- Case type 2, the user user will be able to see the registered items
- If there is no registered item, display the message: "There are no registered items"
- Case type 3, the application will be ended.

8️⃣ Build a patient list. Each patient within the list must have:
- name
- age
- weight
- height

Display a list with the patients' names.

9️⃣ Given a list of patients, find out each patient's BMI and print: "Patient 'X' has a BMI of: 'Y'."
- The letter "X" is the patient's name and "Y" is the patient's BMI.
- Build a function to calculate BMI.
